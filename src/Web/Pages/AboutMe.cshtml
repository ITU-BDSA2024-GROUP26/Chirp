@page "/about-me"
@model Web.Pages.AboutMeModel

@* Page where a logged in user can see his data as well as download or delete it, to comply with GDPR
    Note that if you aren't logged in no navigation element will be shown, but you can still write chirp.com/about-me, which would give you an error page.
    This isn't really a problem as a user not logged in has no reason to go to that address.  *@
